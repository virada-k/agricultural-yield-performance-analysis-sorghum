# 🌾 Project Title & Objective
**Title:** Sorghum Yield Analysis (2001-2005)
**Objective**
This project analyzes the performance of 28 sorghum genotypes across three different locations: Kobo, Melkassa, and Mieso.
The goal is to identify which seeds provide the highest yields or most stability for farmers.

# 📢 Main Analysis
<br>

### 1. Top 5 High-Yield Genotypes

<br>

<br>
**Summary**
<br>
This chart identifies the top five varieties with the highest average yield. These findings provide a data-driven basis for recommending the most productive varieties for large-scale farming.

<br>

### 2. Bottom 5 Low-Yield Genotypes

<br>

<br>

**Summary**
<br>
This chart identifies the five varieties with the lowest average yield. These results help decision-makers consider excluding them from future planting plans to reduce farming costs.

# 🔑 Key Findings:
- Best Location: Kobo is the most productive area for sorghum cultivation.
- The Turning Point: In 2003, we saw a massive "jump" in yields due to the introduction of new genotypes (G01–G15).
- The Champion Battle: G01 is the leader for High Yield but has high risk. Meanwhile, G11 is the best for Stability, making it the safest choice, especially for the Mieso location.
